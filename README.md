# Comparison between KNIME and Python Machine Learning Models

A repo to show comparison between models exported from KNIME and Python.

Things to compare:
1. Train deep learning models using Keras in Python and export to KNIME.
2. Load the deep learning models exported from KNIME to evaluate the results in Python.
3. Repeat steps 1-2 for a conventional machine learning model (e.g. Decision Tree)
4. Compare the evaluation results done in Python and KNIME.
